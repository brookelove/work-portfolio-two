# Motivation
I wanted to recreate my portfolio because four weeks ago I did not even know what github was! It is a good progress report to understanding what I did and allows for a confidence boost. 

# What I learned 

 During the implementation of this application, I lerned alot about how I knew more than I thought I would. It was an interesting realization. I restarted this project from scratch which made me understand what I felt comfortable with and didn't. I learned more about flexboxs and their usefullness. 
 
# Technology Used 
 - HTML 
 - CSS
# To the Future

I would definately apply more javascript, make the page scroll down to the section on click. I would also add some graphics to the page. 

# Mock Up
